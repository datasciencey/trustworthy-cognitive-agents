### About This Book
This text serves as the primary reference for the course on building **Consequence-Aware Artificial Intelligence**. 

While Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in fluency and pattern matching, they fundamentally lack the safeguards required for high-stakes enterprise and safety-critical domains (Healthcare, Finance, Autonomous Systems).

This book bridges the gap between the probabilistic intuition of deep learning ("System 1") and the deterministic rigor of software engineering ("System 2"). It provides a practical, architectural guide to designing agents that are not only capable but **accountable**.

### Key Themes
*   **The Reliability Gap:** Why "fast guesses" are insufficient for agency.
*   **The Neuro-Symbolic Stack:** Architectures that pair neural perception with symbolic logic.
*   **Knowledge Engineering:** Using Knowledge Graphs as the operating system for agency.
*   **Governance:** Implementing "Guardrails as Code."
